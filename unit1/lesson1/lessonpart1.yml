  ### Definition of a variable


  In Python, a variable is like a container that holds information. Think of it
  as a label you can use to store and access data in your program. For example,
  you might use a variable to store a number, a word, or even a list of items.


  ### Why Do We Use Variables?


  Variables make it easier to write programs that can process and manipulate
  data. Instead of hardcoding values, you can use variables to store information
  that might change or be reused multiple times.


  ### How to Create a Variable in Python


  To create a variable in Python, you simply choose a name for your variable and
  assign a value to it using the `=` operator. Hereâ€™s an example:


  ```python

  # Creating a variable to store a number

  age = 16


  # Creating a variable to store a word

  name = "Alex"


  # Creating a variable to store a decimal number

  height = 5.9

  ```


  ### Rules for Naming Variables


  1. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (`_`).

  2. They cannot start with a number.

  3. Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

  4. They are case-sensitive, meaning `Age` and `age` are different variables.


  ### Practice: Try It Yourself!


  1. Create a variable called `favorite_color` and assign it your favorite color
  as a string.

  2. Create a variable called `year` and assign it the current year as a number.


  Example:


  ```python

  favorite_color = "blue"

  year = 2023

  ```


  ### Quick Tip


  Use meaningful names for your variables so your code is easier to read and
  understand. For example, use `age` instead of `a` or `height` instead of `h`.


  Now that you know the basics of variables, you're ready to start using them in
  your Python programs!

          - id: "2"
            value: name = 'Alex'
            explanation: This is a correct way to create a variable with a string value.

          - id: "3"
            value: height = 5.9.0
            explanation: This is incorrect because the value is not a valid decimal number.
