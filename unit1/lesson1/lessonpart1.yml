  ### What Are Variables?


  In Python, a variable is a name that refers to a value stored in memory. Think
  of a variable as a container that holds information you can use and manipulate
  in your program. Variables make your code dynamic and reusable by allowing you
  to store and update data.


  ### Declaring Variables


  To create a variable in Python, you simply assign a value to a name using the
  `=` operator. For example:


  ```python

  # Assigning a value to a variable

  name = "Alice"

  age = 25

  height = 5.6

  ```


  In this example:

  - `name` is a variable that stores the string `"Alice"`.

  - `age` is a variable that stores the integer `25`.

  - `height` is a variable that stores the floating-point number `5.6`.


  ### Rules for Variable Names


  When naming variables in Python, follow these rules:

  1. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (`_`).

  2. They cannot start with a number.

  3. Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

  4. They are case-sensitive (`myVariable` and `myvariable` are different).


  Examples of valid variable names:

  ```python

  my_variable = 10

  _name = "John"

  age2 = 30

  ```


  Examples of invalid variable names:

  ```python

  2name = "Error"  # Starts with a number

  my-variable = 10  # Contains a hyphen

  ```


  ### Updating Variables


  You can change the value of a variable at any time in your program. For
  example:


  ```python

  score = 0  # Initial value

  score = 10  # Updated value

  print(score)  # Output: 10

  ```


  ### Why Are Variables Important?


  Variables allow you to:

  - Store data for later use.

  - Make your programs flexible and dynamic.

  - Write cleaner and more organized code.


  In the next lesson, weâ€™ll explore how to use variables with different data
  types and operations.
